                <p>
                    College students have irregular sleep schedules. Due to the irregular nature of college life, college students find that their sleep cycles 
                    slowly slip out of their normal routine. Oftentimes, students will stay up into the small hours of the night studying and wake up around noon 
                    to go to afternoon classes. This issue gets worse around exam season, when students often put their grades above their physical health. 
                    It isn’t uncommon to see students pull all-nighters in the library to try to study as much as they can before their final exams. 
                    Right now, students may not be fully aware of the long-term impacts this kind of behavior might have on their health. 
                    I want to build a website that tracks a student’s sleep over a set period and suggests improvement tips like cleaning up sleep hygiene so that 
                    students can improve their sleep over time. Most sleep tracking apps are based on gadgets and focus on athletes and other groups of people but 
                    there don’t seem to be too many sleep apps for students to use. Schools are already implementing methods to try to promote better sleep habits. 
                    For example, Harvard offers a class on how to get better sleep, and Baylor University offers extra credit points in their “8-hour challenge”. 
                    I think that if we can expand on what these schools are doing on a digital interface, we can increase the impact we make.

                <h2>App Description</h2>
                <p>
                    The application users will be college students, mostly students who are trying to get their sleep schedule back on track again. 
                    The website will display information about how to improve sleep hygiene, have an input for students to log in their wake-up and sleep times, 
                    and also have a progress graph for them to view their progress with a data visualization model. I plan to have users track when they wake up, 
                    when they go to bed, and when they fall asleep. The difference between the two latter elements can be tracked with an analog clock or some other 
                    timekeeper of their choice. After inputting their sleep times, the users can view a dynamically generated data visualization of their sleep over time. 
                    Depending on their results the website will offer pertinent tips on how to improve their sleep schedule and encouragement for them to do better.

                    I’m hoping this app will create a structured way for students to improve their sleep. Logging in waking hours and sleeping hours will hold students 
                    accountable for their sleep habits and create awareness of what bad sleep habits they might currently have. Once a problem is identified, 
                    the web app can help students take gainful steps in improving their current sleep habits by offering advice.
