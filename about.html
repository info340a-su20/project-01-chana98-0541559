                <h2>Problem Domain</h2>
                    <h3>The Current Situation</h3>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://www.mattressadvisor.com/college-students-sleep/" target="_blank">College students have irregular sleep schedules.</a> 
                        Due to the irregular nature of college life, college students find that their sleep cycles slowly slip out of their normal routine. 
                        Oftentimes, students will stay up into the small hours of the night studying and wake up around noon to go to afternoon classes. 
                        This issue gets worse around exam season, when students often put their grades above their physical health. 
                        It isn’t uncommon to see students pull all-nighters in the library to try to study as much as they can before their final exams. 
                        Right now, students may not be fully aware of the long-term impacts this kind of behavior might have on their health. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Our Potential Solution</h3>
                    <p>
                        We want to build a website that tracks a student’s sleep over a set period and suggests improvement tips like cleaning up sleep hygiene so that 
                        students can improve their sleep over time. Most sleep tracking apps are based on gadgets and focus on athletes and other groups of people but 
                        there don’t seem to be too many sleep apps for students to use. Schools are already implementing methods to try to promote better sleep habits. 
                        <a href="https://www.sleepadvisor.org/college-sleep-statistics/" target="_blank">For example,</a> Harvard offers a class on how to get better sleep, and Baylor University offers extra credit points in their “8-hour challenge”. 
                        I think that if we can expand on what these schools are doing on a digital interface, we can increase the impact we make.

                <h2>App Description</h2>
                <p>
                    The application users will be college students, mostly students who are trying to get their sleep schedule back on track again. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The website will have: 
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Advice on how to improve sleep hygiene</li>
                        <li>Input logs to record wake-up and sleep times</li>
                        <li>Dynamically generated data visualization of the user's sleep over time</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    We plan to have users track when they wake up, when they go to bed, and when they fall asleep.
                    The difference between the two latter elements can be tracked with an analog clock or some other timekeeping device of their choice.
                    If the time isn't kept we'll have the user do a qualitative observation, asking them how long they felt it took them to fall asleep. 
                    Depending on the user's results the website will offer pertinent tips on how to improve their sleep schedule and encouragement for them to do better.
                    We're hoping this app will create a structured way for students to improve their sleep. Logging in waking hours and sleeping hours will hold students 
                    accountable for their sleep habits and create awareness of what bad sleep habits they might currently have. Once a problem is identified, 
                    the web app can help students take gainful steps in improving their current sleep habits by offering advice.
