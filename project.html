    <section>Problem Description</section>
    <p>The problem I want to design an application around is managing the amount of sleep that you are getting. In college life, getting an appropriate amount of sleep helps us function properly with our day-to-day activities. However, things like partying, pulling an all-nighter for a test, or staying up to game with your friends can really throw off your sleep schedule. <cite><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-sleep-you-need">Many things happen in our sleep, like muscle recovery, emotion and metabolism regulation.</a></cite> If your sleep gets disrupted, these functions also get disrupted and can lead to <cite><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sleep/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-lose-sleep#:~:text=What%20happens%20if%20you%20don,diabetes%2C%20and%20even%20car%20accidents.">less functionality during the day, as well as a less healthy lifestyle overall.</a></cite> Additionally, even if you do sleep for the recommended amount of time, you also need to make sure that you are also receiving quality amounts of sleep. By getting the right amount of quality sleep, you can live a healthier lifestyle overall.</p>
    <p><cite><a href="https://www.sleepassociation.org/sleep-treatments/sleep-apps/">There have been several apps that help improve your sleep, ranging from measuring sleep patterns to playing music that is relaxing to fall asleep to, to timing your sleep for a power nap.</a></cite> However, these services either cost a lot for premium access, or only provide short-term services. While they may help with tracking sleep patterns or help you fall asleep faster, they donâ€™t actually help you regulate your sleep schedule, or address other causes of bad sleep like insomnia or sleep apnea.</p>
    <section>App Description</section> 
    <p>The users of the application would be able to utilize several services to improve their sleep, such as tracking their sleep patterns, setting up a sleep-time playlist, or setting up a sleep schedule for themselves. The application would also have a recording function for users who may have sleep apnea, so that they can record themselves to verify and be able to contact their medical provider as soon as possible. The data that the users would be interacting with is their own; while the application may recommend some facets like sleep schedules or relaxing music, in the end the user is the one that decides what that will be. The user will track their own sleep patterns and recordings, and no one else. This is to ensure a form of privacy for the user.</p>
    <p>The type of interactions I expect between the user and the application:</p> 
    <ul class="orderedlist">
        <li>User would be inputting their personal data so that the application can determine a possible treatment.</li>
        <li>Selecting various plans (sleep pattern tracking, relaxing music, etc.) to try and treat their lack of sleep.</li>
        <li>Keep track of the recorded sleep data over a few days.</li>
        <li>Contact their medical provider.</li>
        <li>Monitoring their recorded data to see if there is a noticeable change.</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>Using this application would help users treat their sleep in a convenient/affordable way. College students may struggle with time management and balancing their work and social life, which can lead to a lack of sleep among other things. This application aims to provide the most amount of services possible to improve sleep that the user can pick and choose with the time they have.</p>
